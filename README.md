The Block World Problem is a foundational problem in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics that serves as a framework for exploring concepts related to planning, reasoning, and problem-solving. 
Developed a Python node for setting initial and goal states.
Implemented a C++ subscriber node to receive and process real-time data and utilized the A* algorithm for efficient pathfinding in the Block Worlds problem.
Employed OOP using design patterns  for modular and maintainable code.
